	gh extension to count the number of PRs with the same label as the directory name.

	For example:

	gh pr-count 2023-10-01 2023-10-31 # Count the number of PRs in October 2023
	gh pr-count 2023-11-01            # Count the number of PRs since November 1st, 2023 until now
	`,

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.

	// Cobra supports persistent flags, which, if defined here,
	// will be global for your application.

	// rootCmd.PersistentFlags().StringVar(&cfgFile, "config", "", "config file (default is $HOME/.gh-pr-count.yaml)")

	// Cobra also supports local flags, which will only run
	// when this action is called directly.
